# twitter-bot-trumpdata

#### Twitter bot created using Node.js. @EEbot3 (feel free to follow) tweets a list of the most commonly used words in Donald Trump's ~50 most recent tweets approximately every 12 hours. Only includes words longer than 3 letters to avoid words such as 'the', 'and', 'a', etc. Deployed using heroku. All my logic located in TrumpData.js.

### Utilizes twit API: https://github.com/ttezel/twit
